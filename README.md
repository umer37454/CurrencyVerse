## Description

As a Full Stack Web Developer, I developed a web application that provides users with access to detailed information on 150+ coins and exchanges. The application features a dynamic user interface with a navbar that allows users to seamlessly switch between viewing different data sets. The coins page features coin cards with additional details that are displayed when clicked on.

To enhance the user experience, I included features such as the ability to filter coins and exchange prices in different currencies, including INR, EUR, and USD. Additionally, the application includes a search bar and pagination to facilitate easy navigation and retrieval of relevant information.

As part of the development process, I ensured that the application could handle errors in the backend effectively. Overall, this project showcases my skills in full-stack web development, including designing responsive user interfaces and implementing robust backend systems.
